## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the DotMate Repository

Start by cloning the DotMate repository to your home directory (or a preferred location):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshay-na/DotMate.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

### Step 2: Install DotMate

Run the setup with:

```bash
sudo apt install make
make install
```

This command:

- **Installs essential tools** for your environment.
- **Backs up any existing configurations** to prevent accidental overwrites.
- **Creates symlinks** for dotfiles in the repository for easy configuration management.

**Need only the symlinks?** Use:

```bash
make stow
```

This command skips tool installation and only creates symlinks for your dotfiles.

## üìã Using DotMate

### Update Your Dotfiles

Keeping your dotfiles up-to-date is as simple as running:

```bash
make update
```

If you‚Äôre using `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` from this repository, DotMate has an **auto-update feature** that notifies you of available updates, so you always stay current.

### Avoid Accidental Overwrites

DotMate automatically backs up any existing configurations in `~/dotfiles_backup/<timestamp>`. So if you run `make install` or `make stow` by mistake, your previous settings are saved, making it easy to revert if needed.

### Selective Configuration with Stow

Apply only the configurations you need with Stow. For example, to set up just the `shell` and `nvim` configurations:

```bash
make stow CONFIGS="shell nvim"
```

This flexibility lets you sync only the configurations you want, giving you control over what gets applied to each machine.

## üß© Customizing Your Dotfiles

DotMate comes with a set of essential configurations, but customization is easy! For personal tweaks without overwriting shared configurations, create a `.<config_name>_local` file. This way, you can keep global settings while adding machine-specific customizations.

### Supported Customizations:

| Configuration File | Local Customization File |
| --- | --- |
| `.gitconfig` | `~/.gitconfig_local` |
| `starship.toml` | `~/.config/starship_local.toml` |
| `.taskrc` | `~/.taskrc_local` |
| `.npmrc` | `~/.npmrc_local` |
| `.bashrc` | `~/.bashrc_local` |
| `.commonrc` | `~/.commonrc_local` |
| `.tmux.conf` | `~/.tmux_local.conf` |
| `.zshrc` | `~/.zshrc_local` |

For example, to add your own Starship prompt configuration, create a `~/.config/starship_local.toml` file and add your customizations there. DotMate will load these local files if they exist, giving you full control.

**Note**: Local files override initial configurations, so double-check before saving to ensure it‚Äôs set up the way you want.

## üí° Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Permissions**: DotMate applies strict permissions on sensitive files, like `.gnupg` and `.ssh/config`, to protect your data. Ensure you have permission to edit these files if needed.
- **Restoring Backups**: Backups are saved in `~/dotfiles_backup/<timestamp>`. To restore a previous configuration, simply copy files from this directory back to your home folder.
- **Need Help?** Run `make help` to view available DotMate commands and their descriptions.
